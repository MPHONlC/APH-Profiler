## Dependencies

Requires **LibAPH** (shared helper library, hard dependency).

Optionals for additional features:
- **LibAddonMenu-2.0:** required for the PC Settings Menu.
- **LibHarvensAddonSettings:** required for the Console Settings Menu.
- **LibDebugLogger:** optional logging.

Without the optional dependencies, the addon still runs entirely independently and can be controlled via built-in slash commands as a standalone utility.

## Slash Commands

- `/aphp`: starts recording.
- `/aphpstop`: stops recording and reads the result.
- `/aphpreport`: opens the results window with the last report.
- `/aphpwindow`: shows or hides the results window.
- `/aphpexport`: opens the last report as text you can copy (PC).

> [!WARNING]
> **Console Testing Notes:** This addon was developed and tested on **PC / Steam Deck** *(using Force Console Flow for console testing)*.

**Inspired the idea of APH-Profiler:**

- I wanted a lightweight profiler for console, and a way to compare two data points and view their timeline without exporting anything.
